  <p>Almost everything now has some kind of a manual, instruction, or handbook with all the necessary theory to make the process of learning and using much easier for us. Programming languages also have all these! It's called documentation. It can be about the language itself or a separate library but the main purpose of the documentation is to explain the functionality and usage. Pretty soon you'll get introduced to Python documentation, its importance, and learn to effectively work with it. For now, we suggest you do a little pre-training and go to the official <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Python page</a>, on the homepage you can find the definition of Python, choose the one given there.</p>
